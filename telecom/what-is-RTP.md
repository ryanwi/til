# What is RTP?

> The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC, television services and web-based push-to-talk features.

> RTP is designed for sending and receiving real time media. To that end, it is implemented on top of UDP and focuses on low latency delivery.

> WebRTC does NOT use RTP. That is because RTP isnâ€™t secured. WebRTC uses SRTP instead which can be viewed as the secure variant of RTP.
