# What is ICE?

> Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a framework to allow your web browser to connect with peers. There are many reasons why a straight up connection from Peer A to Peer B won't work. It needs to bypass firewalls that would prevent opening connections, give you a unique address if like most situations your device doesn't have a public IP address, and relay data through a server if your router doesn't allow you to directly connect with peers. ICE uses STUN and/or TURN servers to accomplish this, as described below.
