# What is SDP?

> Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a standard for describing the multimedia content of the connection such as resolution, formats, codecs, encryption, etc. so that both peers can understand each other once the data is transferring. This is, in essence, the metadata describing the content and not the media content itself.
>
> Technically, then, SDP is not truly a protocol, but a data format used to describe connection that shares media between devices.
