# What is a SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)?

> SFU stands for Selective Forwarding Unit. Also known in the specifications as SFM (Selective Forwarding Middlebox).

> An SFU is capable of receiving multiple media streams and then decide which of these media streams should be sent to which participants.


## Compared with a MCU multipoint controller unit

With a SFU, the server will send multipe streams down to connected participants. With a MCU, the server will send just one stream to each connected participant.
